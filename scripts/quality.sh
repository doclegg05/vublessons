# The quality gate for vublessons (education-toolkit contract).
# CI (.github/workflows/quality.yml -> the toolkit's reusable workflow) runs a
# gitleaks secret scan and then this script; run it locally before pushing.
#
# Checks, in order:
#   1. npm run build:site        — copy the PUBLISH tree to dist/site, assert
#                                  REQUIRED_FILES, and (via build-site.js) run
#                                  the courses.json drift check
#   2. tools/link-check.py       — internal links across courses/, instructors/,
#                                  index.html; exits 1 on any broken link
#   3. scripts/check-courses.mjs — courses.json <-> courses/ tree drift check
#   4. Playwright suite          — the full suite against the built
#                                  dist/site. Nothing is quarantined: the 5
#                                  dl1-sidebar-scroll cases were fixed
#                                  2026-07-28 (see .claude/MEMORY.md) and pass.
#   5. scripts/a11y-check.mjs    — axe-core WCAG A/AA scan (computed contrast)
#                                  of the homepage, course/assessment entries,
#                                  every lesson entry, and instructor pages.
#                                  Blocking ratchet: fails only
#                                  on violations beyond the committed shrink-only
#                                  allowlist scripts/a11y-baseline.json.
